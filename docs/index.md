# LyoPRONTO: Getting Started

WIP: see https://realpython.com/python-project-documentation-with-mkdocs/ for a tutorial I am following

See also https://entangled.github.io/mkdocs-plugin/setup/ because it would be nice to use for examples & tests

https://github.com/jimporter/mike?tab=readme-ov-file for versioning the docs
