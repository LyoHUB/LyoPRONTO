# Interactive Simulation
Run an interactive LyoPRONTO simulation at http://lyopronto.rcac.purdue.edu 

# Using This Code
Download this repository, then in your preferred command line navigate to the containing directory (so that `LyoPronto` is a subdirectory).
Execute:
```
python3 LyoPronto.main -m
```
This will execute the file `main.py` in an appropriate scope. Parameters can be changed in `main.py`. Files listing the inputs and outputs will be generated in the current directory, along with some plots of temperature, pressure, and drying progress vs. time.
