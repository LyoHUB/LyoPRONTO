LyoPRONTO is an open-source user-friendly tool to simulate and optimize freezing and primary drying in lyophilizers written using Python.

# Authors
Original authors: Gayathri Shivkumar, Petr S. Kazarin and Alina A. Alexeenko.
Maintained and updated by Isaac S. Wheeler.

# Interactive Simulation
A web-based GUI is available for this software at http://lyopronto.geddes.rcac.purdue.edu.

# How to Use This Code Directly
Download this repository, then in your preferred command line navigate to the containing directory (so that `LyoPronto` is a subdirectory).
Execute:
```
python3 LyoPronto.main -m
```
This will execute the file `main.py` in an appropriate scope. Parameters can be changed in `main.py`. Files listing the inputs and outputs will be generated in the current directory, along with some plots of temperature, pressure, and drying progress vs. time.
A video tutorial by the authors illustrating this process can be found [on LyoHUB's YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/DI-Gz0pBI0w).
